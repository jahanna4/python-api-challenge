# Python API Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities across the world.

Python and OpenWeatherMap API were used in this challenge. Random functionality was used to generate a list of latitude and longitude pairings. These pairings were then used to perform API calls of weather data for each city. Weather information was outputted to .CSV file format and then used to plot various weather combinations by latitude (ex; latitude vs. humidity). Linear regression was applied on top of plots to determine if there was any trend or correlation in the data.

Output file was imported into a separate Jupyter Notebook.
