# Python API Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities across the world.

Python and OpenWeatherMap API were used in this challenge. Random functionality was used to generate a list of latitude and longitude pairings. These pairings were then used to perform API calls of weather data for each city.
